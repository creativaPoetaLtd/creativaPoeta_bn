# Contact Management System Enhancement

## Overview

Enhanced the contact form system to include database storage, admin dashboard management, and reply functionality - similar to the project form system.

## Features Added

### 1. **Database Storage**

- All contact form submissions are now saved to MongoDB
- Enhanced `Query` model with reply tracking fields
- Status management (pending, replied, closed)

### 2. **Admin Dashboard Management**

- View all contact queries with pagination
- Filter by status (all, pending, replied, closed)
- View individual query details
- Reply to queries with email notifications
- Update query status
- Delete queries

### 3. **Reply System**

- Send personalized replies to contact inquiries
- Automatic email notifications to users
- Track reply history (message, timestamp, admin who replied)
- Professional email templates with original message context

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints

```
POST /api/contact/send - Submit contact form
```

### Admin Endpoints (Require Authentication)

```
GET /api/contact?page=1&limit=10&status=all - Get all queries with pagination
GET /api/contact/:id - Get single query
POST /api/contact/:id/reply - Reply to query
PUT /api/contact/:id/status - Update query status
DELETE /api/contact/:id - Delete query
```

## Database Schema Enhancement

### Query Model Fields

```typescript
{
  name: string;           // Contact person's name
  email: string;          // Contact email
  message: string;        // Original inquiry message
  status: "pending" | "replied" | "closed";
  isReplied: boolean;     // Quick flag for reply status
  replyMessage?: string;  // Admin's reply
  repliedAt?: Date;       // When reply was sent
  repliedBy?: string;     // Admin email who replied
  createdAt: Date;        // When inquiry was submitted
  updatedAt: Date;        // Last modification
}
```

## Email Integration

### Contact Form Submission

- Sends notification email to admin with inquiry details
- Includes query ID for easy reference

### Reply Email

- Professional template with personalized response
- Includes original message for context
- Branded with Creativa Poeta signature

## Usage Examples

### Frontend Integration

```typescript
// Get contact queries for dashboard
const getContactQueries = async (page = 1, limit = 10, status = "all") => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
  const response = await axios.get(`/api/contact`, {
    params: { page, limit, status },
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
  });
  return response.data;
};

// Reply to a query
const replyToQuery = async (
  queryId: string,
  replyMessage: string,
  subject: string
) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
  const response = await axios.post(
    `/api/contact/${queryId}/reply`,
    { replyMessage, subject },
    { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } }
  );
  return response.data;
};
```

## Testing Results ✅

All endpoints tested and working:

1. **Contact Form Submission**: ✅ Saves to DB + sends email
2. **Admin Dashboard**: ✅ Fetches queries with pagination
3. **Single Query View**: ✅ Returns detailed query info
4. **Reply System**: ✅ Sends reply + email notification
5. **Status Updates**: ✅ Updates query status
6. **Delete Functionality**: ✅ Removes queries
7. **Filtering**: ✅ Filter by status works correctly

## Security

- All admin endpoints protected with JWT authentication
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Graceful error handling for email failures
- Sanitized email content to prevent XSS

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Dashboard**: Create admin interface for contact management
2. **Analytics**: Add query statistics and response time tracking
3. **Templates**: Create reusable reply templates
4. **Notifications**: Add real-time notifications for new inquiries

## Files Modified

- `/src/models/Query.ts` - Enhanced with reply fields
- `/src/controllers/contactController.ts` - Complete rewrite with 6 new functions
- `/src/routes/contactRoutes.ts` - Added 5 new admin-protected routes
- `/src/routes/projectRoute.ts` - Fixed missing auth middleware

The contact management system is now fully functional and ready for frontend integration!
